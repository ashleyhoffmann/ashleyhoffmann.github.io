            <p style="color:#e5e7e8"><span style="text-decoration:underline">May 2020</span>: I am looking for people to interview! Please <a href="/contact.html" class="links">contact me</a> if you're interested!<br><br></p>
            <p class="header" style="color:black">Mission Statement</p>
            <p>Climate Interviews is a space centering the voices of femme-identifying and non-binary people who make a difference for the climate.</p>
            <p>That said, Climate Interviews is fundamentally meant to be inclusive. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Anyone</span> who feels their voice is underrepresented in the environmental field (people with disabilities, people of color, LGBTQ+, etc.) is welcome to be interviewed!</p>
            <p>As a woman who recently studied Climate Science (at UCLA), I've found it difficult to find femme-identifying mentors in the field, so I'm attempting to create a resource for other people like me who are looking for inspiration and guidance from voices that aren't always easily findable.</p>
            <p>I'm also not exclusively looking for scientists. Sustainability consultants, fundraisers, etc -- I want to spotlight anyone who helps the climate.</p>
            <p>If you want to get involved, please contact me! I am definitely looking for interview guests. I also plan to expand to having a Climate Club of people looking to connect with other people in the environmental field, as well as a thriving Resources page.</p>
            <p>I'm really excited to start on this journey! If you want to contribute in any way, get in touch!</p>
