            <p style="color:#e5e7e8"><span style="text-decoration:underline">May 2020</span>: I am looking for people to interview! <br>Please email me if you're interested! <span style="color:#84344e">hello@climateinterviews.com</span><br></p>
            <p>You can also reach out through social media -- more info <a href="/contact.html" class="links">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="interview-header">Interview Process</p>
            <p>The interview process is fully in your control! I also want to note that I was a manager in UCLA Radio for 3 years and used to even teach interviewing, so I have a lot of experience in this area.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Initial Communication</span>: Please send me any resources that will help me understand you, your work, where you're coming from, and what you want to talk about! (This could be your biography, resum√©, website, LinkedIn, personal writings, photographs, art, or any of your work or projects.)</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Questions</span>: In response, I'll prepare some interview questions and send them to you to review and edit. I want to talk about what <i>you</i> want to talk about! Our conversation will really be in your control.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Pre-Interview</span>: Let's talk! Ideally we can find a 10-15 minute free window for a pre-interview to chat about the interview questions and topics. We can also discuss the mini introductory biography that will accompany the interview.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Interview</span>: We can conduct the interview over video chat (Zoom), or through the phone if connectivity/technology is an issue for you. I assume it will run about 35 minutes including a few minutes of setting up and greetings, but it could be shorter (15-20 minutes) if necessary, or longer (45-55 minutes) if you have the time. </p>
              <p>If there is anything you say that you want redacted, you're absolutely welcome to edit or omit answers! You can also add statements or clarifications after the interview.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Post-Interview</span>: I'll transcribe the piece, edit it, and publish it to the site! I'll also advertise the interview on <a href="/contact.html" class="links">social media</a>.</p>
            <br><p class="interview-header">Candidacy for Being Interviewed</p>
            <p>Climate Interviews is a space centering the voices of femme-identifying and non-binary people who make a difference for the climate.</p>
            <p>That said, Climate Interviews is fundamentally meant to be inclusive. <i>Anyone</i> who feels their voice is underrepresented in the environmental field (people with disabilities, people of color, LGBTQ+-identifying, etc.) is welcome to be interviewed!</p>
            <p>As a woman who recently studied Climate Science (at UCLA), I've found it difficult to find femme-identifying mentors in the field, so I'm attempting to create a resource for other people like me who are looking for inspiration and guidance from voices that aren't always easily findable.</p>
            <p>I'm also not exclusively looking for scientists. Sustainability consultants, fundraisers, etc -- I want to spotlight anyone who helps the climate.</p>
            <p>If you want to get involved, please contact me! I am definitely looking for interview guests. I also plan to expand to having a Climate Club of people looking to connect with other people in the environmental field, as well as a thriving Resources page.</p>
            <p>I'm really excited to start on this journey! If you want to contribute in any way, get in touch!</p><br>
